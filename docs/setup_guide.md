# Snowflake Security Lake Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup process, ensure you have:

* Snowflake Account with administrative privileges
* AWS S3 bucket or alternative log storage solution
* SnowSQL CLI installed and configured
* Appropriate access permissions for all systems

## Installation Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Schema

First, deploy the security lake schema using SnowSQL:

```sql
snowsql -q "source schema/security_lake_schema.sql;"
```

This will create the necessary tables and views for storing and analyzing security data.

### 2. Configure Log Ingestion

To set up log ingestion:

1. Navigate to the configuration directory
2. Edit the `configs/config.json` file to specify:
   * Log source locations
   * Authentication credentials
   * Ingestion frequency
   * Data retention policies

3. Run the ingestion script:
```bash
bash ingestion/ingest_logs.sh
```

### 3. Deploy Threat Detection

Execute the pre-built threat detection queries:

```sql
snowsql -q "source queries/brute_force_detection.sql;"
```

This will create scheduled tasks that continuously monitor for security threats.

### 4. Dashboard Setup

Set up visualization by importing the pre-configured Grafana dashboard:

1. Open Grafana
2. Navigate to Dashboards â†’ Import
3. Upload `dashboards/grafana_dashboard.json`
4. Configure the Snowflake data source connection

## Next Steps

After completing the initial setup:

* Verify data ingestion is working correctly
* Test threat detection queries
* Configure alert notifications
* Review and adjust retention policies as needed
* Document any custom modifications

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

* Check SnowSQL connection settings
* Verify AWS/storage permissions
* Review ingestion logs
* Ensure all prerequisites are properly configured
